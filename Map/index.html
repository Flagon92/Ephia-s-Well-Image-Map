                The Cinquefoil Rose is a coalition of the forces that once
                fought tooth and nail to free Ephia's Well from Orentid
                occupation. Originally composed of refugees and heroes from
                far-away places, it now exists as a populist movement and formal
                alliance of the occupants of the Krak des Roses. Crucial to the
                citadel's defense, and bearing a never-quite-suppressed enmity
                for Baz'eel and her Janissaries, the Cinquefoil Rose blooms
                still in Ephia's Well... thorns and all.

                The IVth Legion of the Sultan's Janissaries has been given the
                dubious privilege of maintaining law and order in Ephia's Well.
                Called "the Misfortune" by their compeers in Baz'eel, they are
                dominated by an obsession with their perceived ill luck.
                Carrying charms and following their own superstitions, they
                prowl the Well looking for ne'er-do-wells... and "ensuring" they
                find a fair few each time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately for them, they are also the Well's first line of
                defense against invasion, and many find themselves on the wrong
                end of a barbarian's axe, or dragged to Qa'im to suffer a fate
                worse than death.

                The Astronomers of Q'tolip are the free-thinking, eccentric
                collection of scholars gathered under the banner of the
                enigmatic and brilliant visionary, Q'tolip. Seeking to master
                the cosmos through scholarship, they are constantly engaged in
                the quest for knowledge of yore, and indulge in the power that
                comes from such things.

              <p>
                In more practical terms, they are the primary archaeologists and
                magical authority of Ephia's Well, and their maintenance of the
                Shade affords them influence that few other organizations can
                boast. Often, the quest for knowledge is hindered by the
                unlearned, and the Astronomers understand well that their search
                can only be strengthened by cultivating a safe environment for
                their studies to bear fruit.

                  a respected lecturer there. Following his revelation - that
                  the Universe revolves around the Celestial Disc, the Moon, and
                  that all other universal constants must be so re-ordered, he
                  was expelled from the Academies - and the Astronomers are

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Ephia's Well is a small-scale fortress and sometimes-settlement that has long occupied a prominent and central spot on the trade routes between the splendorous cities of the desert, straddling a crossroads of the great Giant's Road. It is said to have been built by the ancient giants thousands of years ago; now their ruinous walls form the innermost quarter of the fortress, surrounding a bountiful oasis that flows outwards from tributaries deep within the earth. The surrounding walls have been built and torn down by conquerors, adventurers, and merchants... again and again and again.</p>
                <p>The most recent incarnation of these attempts at state-building is a small colony-town tucked within the resurgent Sultanate of Baz'eel. It is governed by an assembly of Legates elected from among the Voiced population (those true citizens of the Well who have paid for their right of citizenship) who reign on behalf of the Sultan.</p>

                    <li><strong>The League of White:</strong> Who position themselves as voice for the poor and needy. The seek to give voice to the Voiceless, and ensure that no man goes hungry or unpaid.</li>

                This cavernous and humid chamber built under the Well's main plaza is where the mythical Waters emerge from the depths and are stored.
                Here, the Scribes of the Sublime Garden perform the laborious task of portioning the Well's bounty and distributing it to those who are entitled to a share.
                Watchful Janissaries protect the Cistern, for its corruption would surely spell doom for all who live in the citadel.

                Housed within are the statue of the Pilgrim, which pokes its head and shoulders above the plaza, and the statues of Kneeling Giants, which appear to bow in obeisance to it.

                  <strong>Statue of the Pilgrim:</strong> This enormous sandstone statue is of a hooded and androgynous figure clasping a bowl or cup.
                  Like other statues of giants that litter the Citadel of Ephia’s Well, it is very old and certainly greatly predates the more recent constructions. 
                  It is popularly known as “the Pilgrim” and stretches from some unknown depth to rise above the center of the Citadel’s Plaza. A grove has been cut into it so as to allow the waters of the well to spill from the bowl and into a pool.
                  There are several conflicting legends about what it is intended to depict...

                <li>
                  <strong>The Kneeling Giants:</strong> These sand scoured and weathered figures of tremendous size, kneeling upon the sand, can be found in and around the Well. It is unclear whether they kneel in respect or defeated submission.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Holy Waters:</strong> Ephia’s Well is a satrapy of Baz’eel, and it provides the water that Baz’eel so greatly needs and desires.
                  This strange substance makes Ephia's Well a place worth fighting over. A requirement for potion-making and life-living alike. Its magical properties can close wounds and heal ailments in a heartbeat.
                  The Waterbearers of B'aara hold the Waters to be the tears of the goddess herself, come to reinvigorate the world, though many question the truth of this statement.

                 Anything, it is said, may be bought and sold at the Souk, be it openly or in pipeweed-shrouded dens, from wondrous artifacts to lost relics of Old Formoria to barrels of water destined for far-flung settlement desirous of the Well’s ever-flowing bounty.

                The Tablet is, strictly speaking, a ghetto beyond the gates of Ephia’s Well yet guarded by the shadows of its walls. There, a substantial population of Stonefolk and dwarves reside, along with those who either chaff at or have been made unwelcomed within the citadel.

                 From fencers of stolen goods to unlicensed archaeologists, to merely the impoverished and the destitute, the Tablet absorbs those whom the Well itself could not come to shelter or they who refuse to accept the promised sanctuary of the Well.

                  <strong>The Stonefolk:</strong> The Stonefolk are tall, muscular creatures with brown or pale-grey skin. They have no irises, and their hair exhibits as hard, thin strands.
                    They are a people of uncertain provenance, who have long forgotten their origins. 
                    <br><br>
                    They serve as stonemasons and labourers, else wander in small groups in the company of their groknaks.
<br><br>
                    Stonefolk culture is orally transmitted, and their praise-singers are the living embodiment of their culture. While not unintelligent, they have no patience for book learning and are slow and considered in all things. They have a distaste for violence and warfare.

                  <strong>The High Dwarves:</strong> Gold Dwarves, otherwise known as High Dwarves, are a race of Dwarves that descend from the civilisation of Mount Kulkund, in the north of the Great Ash Desert.
                  <br><br>  
                  High Dwarves are exiles from their ancient home, and many long to reclaim it for their people from the Deep Dwarves who defeated and banished them.
                  <br><br>
                  High Dwarves have a cultural taboo against charity, and consider it a grievous insult both to themselves and to their Ancestors, whom they venerate with an almost-religious respect. Gold Dwarves are naturally suspicious of people who use flattery and 'polite manners'; even saying 'please' and 'thank you' could be seen as cunning manipulative behaviour by a Gold Dwarf.
